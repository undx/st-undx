* st - simple terminal

st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.

#+CAPTION: Simple Terminal in action
[[./assets/st.png]]

* Requirements

In order to build st you need the Xlib header files. Have a look at =config.mk= for details.

* Installation

Edit =config.mk= to match your local setup (st is installed into the =/usr/local= by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if necessary as root):
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
    make clean install
#+END_SRC

* Running st

If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile the st terminfo entry with the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
tic -sx st.info
#+END_SRC

See the man page for additional details.

** Keybinds



For other keybindings see manual page.

** Scripts

- plumb :: universal launcher (plumber)
- st-editscreen :: edit st scrollback buffer into =$EDITOR= (externalpipe).
- st-urlhandler :: handle (copy/launch) urls in scrollback buffer (externalpipe).

* Customization
 st can be customized by creating a custom config.h and (re)compiling the source code. This keeps it fast, secure and
 simple.

 With the =xresources= patch you can customize the following elements in your =~/.Xresources= :
 - fonts (font, font0, font1, fontN)
 - colors (color0..color15, background, foreground, cursorColor)
 - termname
 - shell
 - minlatency
 - maxlatency
 - blinktimeout
 - bellvolume
 - tabspaces
 - borderpx
 - cwscale
 - chscale

 Small example taken from my configuration:
 #+begin_src
st.font0: JetBrainsMono Nerd Font:pixelsize=20:antialias=true:autohint=true
st.font1: FantasqueSansMono Nerd Font:pixelsize=20:antialias=true:autohint=true
 #+end_src
