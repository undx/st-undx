* Requirements

In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


* Installation

Edit =config.mk= to match your local setup (st is installed into the =/usr/local= namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if necessary as root):
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
    make clean install
#+END_SRC

* Running st

If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile the st terminfo entry with the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
tic -sx st.info
#+END_SRC

See the man page for additional details.
